<h3 class="center">ECOTOURISM IN RUR A L MEXICO</h3>
<table class="read-passage-table">
It’s not hard to advocate ecotourism——loosely defined as a form of travel that protects an area of the natural world while enabling the local people to preserve their culture and meet their daily needs.The hard part is making it work.
Mexico，with many natural，still largely unspoiled areas and a land system based on community ownership，seems a likely ecotourism paradise.But its record of tourism development tells a different story.
    
Now，thanks to the efforts of two consultants in Mexico City，the country may have figured out a way to benefit from the ecotourism market that is growing rapidly worldwide.Juan Carlos Ibarra and Antonio Suarez，co-owners of Balam Consultants，have succeeded where many other people have failed，helping local communities develop the ability to operate ecotourism ventures.
    
Ibarra and Suarez began their current line of work in the early 1990s，helping the residents of the community of San Nicolas，outside Mexico City，develop and market recreational facilities that would attract tourists. Ibarra and Suarez spent more than 600 hours teaching people in the community business，marketing，and public relations skills.The result of this project was the San Nicolas Park，which now offers facilities for hiking and mountain biking on 2,304 hectares of land that otherwise would have been lost to illegal logging and urban sprawl.The project’s success is well regarded by professionals from around the world and is the most-visited ecotourism site in Mexico.
    
The product of their efforts “shows what can be done.Its main value is that it enables those who will benefit or suffer most from ecotourism to take the decisions.” says Ron Mader of the website Americas Ecotourism.“The wonder of the work done by Ibarra and Suarez，”Mader says，“is that they make it look very simple.”
    
An advantage for Mexico in the field of ecotourism development is land reforms implemented after the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1917.Property previously owned by the wealthy elite was redistributed to peasant communities in the form of communally owned village lands known as comunidades.
    
Today，more than 23,000 communal groups Own and 1ive on 75 percent of Mexico’s land.Most of the country s splendid snowcapped volcanoes，lush jungles and white sand beaches are also communal property.This means that when tourists come to visit the country’s natural attractions，the local property owners should benefit.
But some heavily promoted resorts，such as Cancun and Bahias de Huatulco，have been built On village lands that were taken by the government and sold to corporations.
Although some local people are hired to work at these resorts，many do not have the appropriate skills or the knowledge of how these corporations work，said Ibarra. As a result，most of the well-paying jobs are filled by people from urban areas who have a better understanding of business Ibarra and Suarez are trying to stop this trend by working with the comunidades to develop community-based ecotourism projects.The two consultants have been conducting workshops on the subject in communities across the country.
    
“In recent years，as the ecotourism boom reached Mexico，many companies started promoting trips to the wilderness areas of the country,” said Ibarra.“In the beginning，the owners of the lands in which ecotourism was being developed were not involved at all.Now，slowly but surely，rural populations have begun to perceive ecotourism as an economic alternative.”
    
Commercially speaking，however，the residents of rural communities usually have no experience in running and marketing a business.Even if they have developed a well run project，visitors won’t come unless there is also effective marketing.After all，it is a business and they need to bring in customers.
Ibarra and Suarez say teaching people in local communities how to run an ecotourism operation is easy.The hard part is helping rural inhabitants overcome a culturally ingrained notion that they are stupid and incapable of running such a business themselves.
    
For every hour devoted to the instruction of business skills，the consultants spend four hours helping local residents build self-esteem and confidence.They are convinced that a project’s success depends on the involvement of the local landowners.
    
Ron Mader views Ibarra and Suarez as pioneers in building successful ecotourism in Mexico.Their work.he says，is“outstanding——not only because they have assisted in development of hiking and biking trails，but because they have demonstrated a profound respect for the communities

<h2>READING PASSAGE 2</h2>
<p class="header-instruction">You should spend about 20 minutes on <strong>Questions 15 – 27,</strong> which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.</p>

<h3 class="center">High-tech Refrigeration</h3>
<table class="read-passage-table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Refrigerators are the epitome of clunky technology: solid, reliable and just a little bit dull. They have not changed much over the past century, but then they have not needed to. They are based on a robust and effective idea--draw heat from the thing you want to cool by evaporating a liquid next to it, and then dump that heat by pumping the vapour elsewhere and condensing it. This method of pumping heat from one place to another served mankind well when refrigerators' main jobs were preserving food and, as air conditioners, cooling buildings. Today's high-tech world, however, demands high-tech refrigeration. Heat pumps are no longer up to the job. The search is on for something to replace them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>One set of candidates are known as paraelectric materials. These act like batteries when they undergo a temperature change: attach electrodes to them and they generate a current. This effect is used in infra-red cameras. An array of tiny pieces of paraelectric material can sense the heat radiated by, for example, a person, and the pattern of the array's electrical outputs can then be used to construct an image. But until recently no one had bothered much with the inverse of this process. That inverse exists, however. Apply an appropriate current to a paraelectric material and it will cool down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Someone who is looking at this inverse effect is Alex Mischenko, of Cambridge University. Using commercially available paraelectric film, he and his colleagues have generated temperature drops five times bigger than any previously recorded. That may be enough to change the phenomenon from a laboratory curiosity to something with commercial applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>As to what those applications might be, Dr Mischenko is still a little hazy. He has, nevertheless, set up a company to pursue them. He foresees putting his discovery to use in more efficient domestic fridges and air conditioners. The real money, though, may be in cooling computers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Gadgets containing microprocessors have been getting hotter for a long time. One consequence of Moore's Law, which describes the doubling of the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months, is that the amount of heat produced doubles as well. In fact, it more than doubles, because besides increasing in number, the components are getting faster. Heat is released every time a logical operation is performed inside a microprocessor, so the faster the processor is, the more heat it generates. Doubling the frequency quadruples the heat output. And the frequency has doubled a lot. The first Pentium chips sold by Dr Moore's company, Intel, in 1993, ran at 60m cycles a second. The Pentium 4--the last "single-core" desktop processor--clocked up 3.2 billion cycles a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Disposing of this heat is a big obstruction to further miniaturisation and higher speeds. The innards of a desktop computer commonly hit 80℃. At 85℃, they stop working. Tweaking the processor's heat sinks (copper or aluminium boxes designed to radiate heat away) has reached its limit. So has tweaking the fans that circulate air over those heat sinks. And the idea of shifting from single-core processors to systems that divided processing power between first two, and then four, subunits, in order to spread the thermal load, also seems to have the end of the road in sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>One way out of this may be a second curious physical phenomenon, the thermoelectric effect. Like paraelectric materials, this generates electricity from a heat source and produces cooling from an electrical source. Unlike paraelectrics, a significant body of researchers is already working on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>The trick to a good thermoelectric material is a crystal structure in which electrons can flow freely, but the path of phonons--heat-carrying vibrations that are larger than electrons--is constantly interrupted. In practice, this trick is hard to pull off, and thermoelectric materials are thus less efficient than paraelectric ones (or, at least, than those examined by Dr Mischenko). Nevertheless, Rama Venkatasubramanian, of Nextreme Thermal Solutions in North Carolina, claims to have made thermoelectric refrigerators that can sit on the back of computer chips and cool hotspots by 10℃. Ali Shakouri, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, says his are even smaller--so small that they can go inside the chip.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>The last word in computer cooling, though, may go to a system even less techy than a heat pump--a miniature version of a car radiator. Last year Apple launched a personal computer that is cooled by liquid that is pumped through little channels in the processor, and thence to a radiator, where it gives up its heat to the atmosphere. To improve on this, IBM's research laboratory in Zurich is experimenting with tiny jets that stir the liquid up and thus make sure all of it eventually touches the outside of the channel--the part where the heat exchange takes place. In the future, therefore, a combination of microchannels and either thermoelectrics or paraelectrics might cool computers. The old, as it were, hand in hand with the new.<br> (830 words)</td>

<div class="passage-container"><h2>Part 3</h2>
<h3 class="center">The History of Early Cinema</h3>

The history of the cinema in its first thirty years is one of major and, to this day, unparalleled expansion and growth. Beginning as something unusual in a handful of big cities - New York, London, Paris and Berlin - the new medium quickly found its way across the world, attracting larger and larger audiences wherever it was shown and replacing other forms of entertainment as it did so. As audiences grew, so did the places where films were shown, finishing up with the 'great picture palaces' of the 1920s, which rivalled, and occasionally superseded, theatres and opera-houses in terms of opulence and splendour. Meanwhile, films themselves developed from being short 'attractions' only a couple of minutes long, to the full-length feature that has dominated the world's screens up to the present day.
    
Although French, German, American and British pioneers have all been credited with the invention of cinema, the British and the Germans played a relatively small role in its world-wide exploitation. It was above all the French, followed closely by the Americans, who were the most passionate exporters of the new invention, helping to start cinema in China，Japan, Latin America and Russia. In terms of artistic development it was again the French and the Americans who took the lead, though in the years before the First World War, Italy, Denmark and Russia also played a part.
    
In the end, it was the United States that was to become, and remain, the largest single market for films. By protecting their own market and pursuing a vigorous export policy, the Americans achieved a dominant position on the world market by the start of the First World War. The centre of film-making had moved westwards, to Hollywood, and it was films from these new Hollywood studios that flooded onto the world s film markets in the years after the First World War, and have done so ever since. Faced with total Hollywood domination, few film industries proved competitive. The Italian industry, which had pioneered the feature film with spectacular films like Quo vadis? (z913) and Cabiria (I9z4), almost collapsed. In Scandinavia, the Swedish cinema had a brief period of glory, notably with powerful epic films and comedies. Even the French cinema found itself in a difficult position. In Europe, only Germany proved industrially capable, while in the new Soviet Union and in Japan the development of the cinema took place in conditions of commercial isolation.
    
Hollywood took the lead artistically as well as industrially. Hollywood films appealed because they had better-constructed narratives, their special effects were more impressive, and the star system added a new dimension to screen acting. If Hollywood did not have enough of its own resources, it had a great deal of money to buy up artists and technical innovations from Europe to ensure its continued dominance over present or future competition.
    
The rest of the world survived partly by learning from Hollywood and partly because audiences continued to exist for a product which corresponded to needs which Hollywood could not supply. As well as popular audiences, there were also increasing audiences for films which were artistically more adventurous or which dealt with the issues in the outer world.
    
None of this would have happened without technology, and cinema is in fact unique as an art form. In the early years, this art form was quite primitive, similar to the original French idea of using a lantern and slides back in the seventeenth century. Early cinema programmes were a mixture of items, combining comic sketches, free-standing narratives, serial episodes and the occasional trick or animated film. With the arrival of the feature-length narrative as the main attraction, other types of films became less important. The making of cartoons became a separate branch of film-making, generally practised outside the major studios, and the same was true of serials. Together with newsreels, they tended to be shown as short items in a programme which led to the feature.
    
From early cinema, it was only American slapstick comedy that successfully developed in both short and feature format. However, during this 'Silent Film' era, animation, comedy, serials and dramatic features continued to thrive, along with factual films or documentaries, which acquired an increasing distinctiveness as the period progressed. It was also at this time that the avant-garde film first achieved commercial success, this time thanks almost exclusively to the French and the occasional German film.
    
Of the countries which developed and maintained distinctive national cinemas in the silent period, the most important were France, Germany and the Soviet Union. Of these, the French displayed the most continuity, in spite of the war and post-war economic uncertainties. The German cinema, relatively insignificant in the pre-war years, exploded on to the world scene after 1919. Yet even they were both overshadowed by the Soviets after the I917 Revolution. They turned their back on the past, leaving the style of the pre-war Russian cinema to the emigres who fled westwards to escape the Revolution.
