<p class="header-instruction">Questions 1 – 8, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.</p>

<h3 class="center">The Hardest Language</h3>
<table class="read-passage-table">
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>People often ask which is the most difficult language to learn, and it is not easy to answer because there are many factors to take into consideration. Firstly, in a first language the differences are unimportant as people learn their mother tongue naturally, so the question of how hard a language is to learn is only relevant when learning a second language.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>A native speaker of Spanish, for example, will find Portuguese much easier to learn than a native speaker of Chinese, for example, because Portuguese is very similar to Spanish, while Chinese is very different, so first language can affect learning a second language. The greater the differences between the second language and our first, the harder it will be for most people to learn. Many people answer that Chinese is the hardest language to learn, possibly influenced by the thought of learning the Chinese writing system, and the pronunciation of Chinese does appear to be very difficult for many foreign learners. However, for Japanese speakers, who already use Chinese characters in their own language, learning writing will be less difficult than for speakers of languages using the Roman alphabet.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>Some people seem to learn languages readily, while others find it very difficult. Teachers and the circumstances in which the language is learned also play an important role, as well as each learner's motivation for learning. If people learn a language because they need to use it professionally, they often learn it faster than people studying a language that has no direct use in their day-to-day life.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>Apparently, British diplomats and other embassy staff have found that the second hardest language is Japanese, which will probably come as no surprise to many, but the language that they have found to be the most problematic is Hungarian, which has 35 cases (forms of a noun according to whether it is subject, object, genitive, etc). This does not mean that Hungarian is the hardest language to learn for everyone, but it causes British diplomatic personnel, who are generally used to learning languages, the most difficulty. However, Tabassaran, a Caucasian language has 48 cases, so it might cause more difficulty if British diplomats had to learn it.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>Different cultures and individuals from those cultures will find different languages more difficult. In the case of Hungarian for British learners, it is not a question of the writing system, which uses a similar alphabet, but the grammatical complexity, though native speakers of related languages may find it easier, while struggling with languages that the British find relatively easy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>F</td>
        <td>No language is easy to learn well, though languages which are related to our first language are easier. Learning a completely different writing system is a huge challenge, but that does not necessarily make a language more difficult than another. In the end, it is impossible to say that there is one language that is the most difficult language in the world.</td>

<p class="header-instruction">You are going to read an article about the Colosseum. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from sentences <strong>A-H</strong> the one which fits each gap <strong>(9-15)</strong>. There is one extra sentence, which you do not need to use.</p>
<h3 class="center">The Colosseum</h3>
<p class="fill-blanks">For years, visitors to the Colosseum have been able to put themselves in the position of the Roman spectator <span><strong>9</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q9"></span> They could look down on the arena where, from 80AD until the games' end in the fifth century, gladiators fought to the death. And, perhaps, they could start to sense the morbid curiosity of the 50,000 spectators.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks">Without access to the amphitheatre's other areas, though, the experience always lacked a key ingredient: how the gladiators themselves would have felt.Until now, that is. For the first time since antiquity, and after a €1m restoration, both the Colosseum's subterranean and third-floor levels are officially open to the public <span><strong>10</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q10"></span>.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks">Due to the archaeological delicacy of the structure, the only way to access these areas is on one of the Colosseum's tours <span><strong>11</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q11"></span>. The wooden platform here is where they would have paraded before the games - calling to the emperor, "We men who are about to die salute thee!"</p>

<p class="fill-blanks">You can then descend into the hypogeum, or underground tunnels and rooms, where the gladiators would have readied themselves for the fights <span><strong>12</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q12"></span>. Today, facing the still-high walls of the hypogeum's narrow chambers, it is easy to imagine just how dark, dank and claustrophobic these tunnels were.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks">But the chambers weren't just holding pens for the waiting gladiators and animals. Here, too, was where some 500 workers would have been laboring behind the scenes. The games included elaborately painted backdrops, costumes, and music - they offered a bloody mix of entertainments. The inaugural games of 80AD, for example, included a gladiatorial contest, a wild-beast hunt, a horse race, and a re-enacted naval battle between 3,000 men, followed by an infantry battle… just in the first three days <span><strong>13</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q13"></span>.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks">Imagining how the gladiators would have felt can only happen when standing in the arena itself. There, on a reconstructed wooden platform covered in sand, you stand on the spot where thousands of men and tens of thousands of beasts were killed. This was where the emperor played god. For the defeated, the only chance of survival was asking for his mercy <span><strong>14</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q14"></span>. Thumbs up or thumbs down: life or death.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks">For a sense of the scale of the Colosseum, meanwhile, you have to go up to the newly opened third floor, where the middle classes would have sat <span><strong>15</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q15"></span>.
It is the combination of Roman ingenuity and brutality that takes your breath away. And in the Colosseum, the best way to get a real sense of it all is to go up - and down.</p>

<h3 class="center">What is Social Networking?</h3>
<table class="read-passage-table">
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>Social networking has become very popular during the past few years, but it can still be very difficult to understand for someone new to social networking. The open-ended nature of social networks adds to this. Once signed onto a social network, having answered a few basic profile questions, it is easy to sit back and wonder what you are supposed to do next.
The easiest way to understand social networking is to think of it like high school. You had friends in school, and you knew quite a few people even if you weren't friends with all of them, but it's likely that you didn't know everyone.
If you ever moved to a new school -- or if you can imagine moving to a new school -- you start out with no friends. After attending classes, you start meeting people, and as you meet them, you begin associating with those that have similar interests.
Getting started with social networking is much the same as starting at a new school. At first, you don't have any friends. But as you join groups, you begin to meet people, and you build a friends list of those with similar interests.
Social networking is based on a certain structure that allows people to both express their individuality and meet people with similar interests. This structure is made of several key features:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td><strong>Profile.</strong> This is where you tell the world about yourself. Profiles contain basic information, like where you live and how old you are, and personality questions, like who is your favorite actor and what is your favorite book. Social networks dedicated to a special theme like music or movies might ask questions related to that theme.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td><strong>Friends.</strong> Friends are trusted members of the site that are allowed to post comments on your profile or send you private messages. You can also keep tabs on how your friends are using social networking, such as when they post a new picture or update their profile. Friends are the heart and soul of social networking. It should be noted that not all social networks refer to them as 'friends' -- LinkedIn refers to them as 'connections -- but all social networks have a way to designate members as trusted.
</td>
    </tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td><strong>Groups.</strong> Most social networks use groups to help you find people with similar interests or engage in discussions on certain topics. A group can be anything from "Johnson High Class of '98" to "People Who Like Books" to “Doors Fans". They are both a way to connect with like-minded people and a way to identify your interests. Sometimes, groups are called by other names, such as the 'networks' on Facebook.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>D</td>
        <td><strong>Discussions.</strong> A primary focus of groups is to create interaction between users in the form of discussions. Most social networking websites support discussion boards for the groups, and many also allow members of the group to post pictures, music, video clips, and other tidbits related to the group.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>E</td>
        <td><strong>Blogs.</strong> Another feature of some social networks is the ability to create your own blog entries. While not as feature-rich as blog hosts like Wordpress or Blogger, blogging through a social network is perfect for keeping people informed on what you are up to.</td>
