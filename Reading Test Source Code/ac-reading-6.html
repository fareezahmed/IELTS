<h3 class="center">Lying. Do you Know When it Happens?</h3>
<table class="read-passage-table">
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>Is he lying? You'll probably never know. Although people have been communicating with one another for tens of thousands of years, more than 30 years of research about the human mind has found that most people are very bad at telling if someone is lying.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>In the only worldwide study of its kind, scientists asked more than 2,000 people from nearly 60 countries a question. "How can you tell when people are lying?" From Botswana to Belgium, the number-one answer was the same: Liars look away from the person they're lying to. "This is... the most common stereotype about lying in the world," says Charles Bond of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. Mr. Bond led the research project. However, looking away, like other common stereotypes about liars, isn't connected with lying at all, studies have shown. Liars don't shift around or touch their noses or clear their throats any more than truth tellers do.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>For years, researchers have done laboratory experiments in an attempt to describe differences between the behavior of liars and people telling the truth. One thing is certain: There is not only one obvious signal for a lie. By studying large groups of participants, researchers have identified certain general behaviors that liars are more likely to have than people who are telling the truth. Liars tend to move their arms, hands, and fingers less and blink less than people telling the truth do. Liars' voices can seem more nervous or high. Liars may move less and fill their speech with pauses because they are trying too hard to remember what they've already said and to keep their stories consistent. People not telling the truth tend to make fewer speech errors than truth tellers do. They rarely backtrack to fill in forgotten or incorrect details. "Their stories are too good to be true," says Bella dePaulo of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has written several reviews of the field of deception research.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>Liars may also feel fear and guilt or excitement at fooling people. Such emotions can cause a change in facial expression so short that most observers never notice. Paul Ekman, a retired researcher from the University of California, San Francisco, calls these split-second changes "micro expressions." He says these emotional clues, such as a smile, a grimace, or a wince, are as important as gestures, voice, and speech patterns in uncovering deceitfulness.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>But not all liars show these signals. Sometimes you can't conclude people are lying because they don't move their arms or pause while telling stories. These could be natural behaviors for them, not signs of lying. "They are statistically reliable signals that people are lying," says Timothy Levine of Michigan State University in East Lansing. But that doesn't mean they're helpful in one-on-one situations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>F</td>
        <td>People are just not very good at spotting deception signals. On average, over hundreds of laboratory studies, people choose correctly between truths and lies only about 55 percent of the time. This success rate is similar for groups as different as students and police officers. "Human ability to spot a liar is really not much better than chance," says dePaulo.</td>

<p class="header-instruction">You are going to read an article about people who enjoy collecting orchids. Seven sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A-H the one which fits each gap (9-15). There is one extra sentence, which you do not need to use.</p>
<h3 class="center">The Orchid Hunters</h3>
<p class="fill-blanks">People have always thought that orchids are fascinating flowers. To many people, they represent passion and mystery <span><strong>9</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q9"></span> But orchids were not always so cheap or common. Many people have risked their lives to discover and collect rare types of orchids. Orchidomania, a word which means “having a strong interest in orchids”, is as common today as it was in the past.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks">Until recently, orchid collecting was a hobby, which only the very rich could do. Orchids were usually found in remote locations and were hard to grow in colder climates <span><strong>10</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q10"></span>. Finally, it became possible for orchid collectors to bring home their beloved plants. From that time, the orchid's popularity increased in England, which is cold for much of the year.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks">Orchid hunters were hired to travel to distant countries and bring back exotic new species. The hunters returned to Europe with thousands of orchids <span><strong>11</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q11"></span> Benedict Roezl was a famous Czech orchid hunter. He discovered 800 new species of orchid from around the world. Another famous orchid grower and hunter, an Englishman named John Day, discovered many varieties and painted thousands of pictures of his beautiful flowers.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks"><span><strong>12</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q12"></span> In 1908, a group of eight orchid hunters went on an expedition to the Philippines. Reports say that one died of a tiger attack, while another was killed by local people (the people of that area were headhunters), and several more died in accidents and illness.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks"><span><strong>13</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q13"></span> He took away 47,000 orchids. Many orchids today are mass-produced—grown in large amounts in big, controlled areas. For many people, however, orchid hunting is still an obsession.</p>

<p class="fill-blanks"><span><strong>14</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q14"></span> In 2000, Tom Hart-Dyke, a young British scientist, went to Central America. He was looking for a new orchid species to name after his grandmother. He was kidnapped and held captive for nine months by guerrillas—an army group fighting against the government. When asked at a press conference whether the trip to the dangerous area had been a silly decision, Hart-Dyke smiled and answered, "No comment."</p>

<p class="fill-blanks"><span><strong>15</strong> <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter a Letter" id="q15"></span>It is because of this passion throughout history, however, that the beautiful orchid is now easily accessible, available for all to enjoy.</p>

    <tr>

        <td>If people want to be successful in multinational business, they must understand the cultures of other countries. They must also learn how to work with them. It's important for them to avoid business decisions based on mistaken ideas.
One cause of error is the belief that one's own culture is better than other cultures. This belief can exist in an individual person or in an organization. In the case of an individual, it takes the form of "we're better than anyone else." On the other hand, there are some strategies you can follow which can help to avoid mistakes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td><strong>Language.</strong> A knowledge of the local language can help an international businessperson in four ways. First, the person can communicate directly, without someone else to translate or explain. Second, people are usually more open in their communication with someone who speaks their language. Third, an understanding of the language allows the person to understand information not said directly. Finally, language helps the person to understand the culture better.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td><strong>Religion.</strong> Religion influences everything about people, including their work habits. In the United States, people talk about the Protestant morals. It simply means a belief that people should work hard and save their money. In many Asian countries, the same idea is called the Confucian morals. In Japan, it is the Shinto morals.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td><strong>Values and Attitudes.</strong> Values are people's basic beliefs about the difference between good and bad. An attitude is a way of thinking or acting. Values and attitudes influence international business. For example, many Russians believe that McDonald's food is good (value), so they wait in long lines to eat it (attitude). U.S. customers believe that chocolate from Switzerland is especially good (value), and they buy a lot of it (attitude).</td>
    </tr>
        <td>D</td>
        <td><strong>Customs and Manners.</strong> Customs are common social practices. Manners are ways of acting that the society believes are polite. For example, in the United States, it is the custom to have salad before the main course at dinner, not after. American table manners include not talking with food in the mouth and keeping the napkin in the lap, not on the table. In some countries, it is polite to arrive at a party very late. However, in others, it is important to be on time. International businesses need to understand the customs and manners of other countries. Otherwise, they will probably have difficulty selling their products. For example, an American orange juice company in France will have a problem if it sells orange juice as a breakfast drink. The reason is that the French don't drink juice with breakfast.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>E</td>
        <td><strong>Material Culture.</strong> Material culture means the things that people make or own. When we study material culture, we need to think about how people make things (technology). We must also think about who makes them and why (economics). International businesses need to understand the country's economic organization (transportation and communications), the social organization (the health and education systems), and the financial organization (banking services). These elements of culture help to explain the differences among people of different cultures. If they don’t understand cultures, multinational companies cannot be successful.</td>
